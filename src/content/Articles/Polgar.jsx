      <Paragraph>
        I would like to offer a short review for everyone interested in
        education of what I consider to be an exceptionally fascinating book —
        Raise a Genius! by László Polgár. For those who are hearing this name
        for the first time or are not familiar with why he deserves attention, I
        will briefly explain the context. Hungarian educator László Polgár and
        his wife Klára Polgár (born in Transcarpathia, Ukraine, and also trained
        as a pedagogue) united around one idea: to conduct a unique
        socio-pedagogical experiment — to raise children with an exceptionally
        high level of development and to prove that genius is not a random
        natural gift, but the result of deliberate, systematic education. Their
        goal was to demonstrate that, with the right approach, almost any family
        is capable of achieving extraordinarily high results in a child's
        development.

      <ArticleSubtitle>The Polgár Daughters</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        The Polgár family raised three daughters who became chess players and
        entered the history of world chess:
      </Paragraph>
      <Strong>Susan Polgar</Strong>
      <Paragraph>
        The first woman to earn the full Grandmaster (GM) title in 1991 (not a
        women-only title). A polyglot who speaks several languages.
      </Paragraph>
      <Strong>Judit Polgár</Strong>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        The strongest female chess player in history. She ranked among the
        world's top 10 chess players overall, competing against both men and
        women. She defeated reigning and former world champions such as Garry
        Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, and Viswanathan Anand. She also became the
        youngest grandmaster in history at the time she earned the title. She
        speaks several languages.
      </Paragraph>
      <Strong>Zsófia Polgár</Strong>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        A chess prodigy, famous for her legendary performance at the Rome 1989
        tournament, where she defeated several grandmasters. She achieved the
        title of International Master. None of the Polgár daughters attended
        traditional public or private schools — they received home education
        under the guidance of their parents.
      </Paragraph>
      <ArticleSubtitle>Attitude Toward Traditional Schooling</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        Polgár believed that the standard school system often limits a child's
        individual development because it is oriented toward the average level
        and standardized curricula. In his view, a child who grows up in an
        environment that constantly stimulates development, goal-setting, and
        new challenges has a far greater chance of fully realizing their
        potential. Polgár also cited examples of famous historical figures who
        struggled in traditional school settings, including:
      </Paragraph>
      <p>
        <p>○ Thomas Mann</p> <p>○ Albert Einstein</p> <p>○ Wilhelm Röntgen</p>
        <p>○ James Watt</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        (He used these examples primarily as illustrations of the limitations of
        the school system, rather than as proof of its complete inadequacy.)
      </p>
      <ArticleSubtitle>Conflicts with State Authorities</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        Due to his refusal to follow traditional schooling, Polgár repeatedly
        came into conflict with state authorities. At various times,
        representatives of official institutions visited him, and administrative
        cases were initiated against him for failing to comply with compulsory
        education requirements. This highlights that his approach was not only
        pedagogically unconventional, but also socially atypical for its time.
        It is important to note that refusing traditional schooling alone does
        not guarantee success. This approach requires an exceptionally high
        level of parental involvement, systematic effort, and discipline from
        both parents and children.
      </Paragraph>
      <ArticleSubtitle>Scientific Foundations of the Approach</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        Before implementing his method, Polgár analyzed hundreds of biographies
        of outstanding individuals in an attempt to identify common
        developmental patterns. His approach was also influenced by the ideas
        and research of scholars and educators such as:
      </Paragraph>
      <p>
        <p>● Benjamin Bloom</p> <p>● Lewis Terman</p> <p>● Glenn Doman</p>{" "}
        <p>● Hans Eysenck</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        (and other researchers in the fields of ability and intelligence
        development).

      <ArticleTitle>The principles and approaches:</ArticleTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        The main principles and approaches to raising a genius outlined by
        László Polgár in his book, which I personally identified as key, include
      </Paragraph>
      <ArticleSubtitle> 📜 Specialization</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        Choosing one specific field of activity for deep and systematic study.
      </Paragraph>
      <ArticleSubtitle>📜 Awakening the child's interest</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        Developing intrinsic motivation through enjoyment of the process,
        sustained interest, and positive reinforcement of achievements.
      </Paragraph>
      <ArticleSubtitle>📜 Providing perspective and meaning</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        If a child does not see a goal or envision future opportunities, it
        becomes difficult for them to act independently without adult support.
      </Paragraph>
      <ArticleSubtitle>📜 Early start to learning</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        Education should begin in early childhood in order to make the most of
        sensitive periods of development. Polgár emphasized that intellectual
        potential is largely shaped during the first years of life.
      </Paragraph>
      <ArticleSubtitle>📜 Intensive and systematic training</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        Daily, regular, and long-term practice that includes hands-on training,
        theory, the development of thinking skills, as well as attention to the
        child's psychological and physical well-being.
      </Paragraph>
      <ArticleSubtitle>📜 Holistic development</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        Combining specialized training with general education: languages,
        sciences, critical thinking, a sense of humor, and pedagogical support.
      </Paragraph>
      <ArticleSubtitle>📜 Belief in success</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        Parental dedication and consistent belief that abilities are developed
        rather than being purely innate.
      </Paragraph>
      <Strong>
        This methodology was implemented in a successful experiment with his
        daughters and demonstrates an unconventional yet consistent approach to
        education.
      </Strong>{" "}
      <ArticleSubtitle>Personal Perspective</ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        Personally, I find Polgár's experience inspiring, as it clearly
        demonstrates that a child's abilities can be significantly influenced,
        and that talent is not exclusively an innate phenomenon. He shows that
        deliberate effort, environment, and the role of parents are decisive
        factors. No school is capable of fully compensating for the absence of
        active parental involvement in a child's development. To a large extent,
        it is the parents who determine how successful and fulfilled a child
        will be in the future.
