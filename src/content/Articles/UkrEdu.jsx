      <Paragraph>
        I have just watched an interview with the Minister of Education and
        Science of Ukraine, Oksen Lisovyi.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        It left me with many thoughts — once again, I became convinced of how
        catastrophic the situation in education truly is.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        This is exactly what we should be talking about. That is why I want to
        voice several important points and share my reflections on the matter.
      </Paragraph>{" "}
      <Paragraph>
        The first problem is the extremely low salary of Ukrainian teachers.
        Many people simply do not believe me when I say that the average
        Ukrainian teacher earns around 200 euros per month. At the same time,
        prices for food and clothing are not lower — and sometimes even higher —
        than in EU countries. For comparison, a supermarket cashier may earn
        around 400 euros, while an IT specialist in Ukraine can make about 2,000
        euros.
      </Paragraph>{" "}

        📜 So how does a Ukrainian teacher survive today?
      </ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        The answer is simple and rather banal: in reality, they don't. Teachers
        often rely on financial support from other family members just to get
        by.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Unfortunately, many educators who dedicated five years of their lives to
        university studies and professional development often end up working as
        cleaners in European countries.
      </Paragraph>{" "}
      <Paragraph>
        It sounds absurd, yet this is the reality — the profession has been
        deeply devalued. One might blame the war, but the truth is that this
        problem has existed throughout the entire history of independent
        Ukraine. It seems that society has long come to terms with it.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The devaluation of education brings other negative consequences.
        Children — and even parents — openly point to teachers’ low income as an
        argument for the “unimportance” of education. And from a purely
        pragmatic perspective, it seems logical: why spend years earning a
        degree if you can make two or even three times more working at a factory
        without one?
      </Paragraph>{" "}
      <ArticleSubtitle>
        📜 With the war, the problem has only intensified.
      </ArticleSubtitle>
      <Paragraph>
        The number of students in schools continues to decline, especially boys.
        Many people are trying by any means to leave a country whose economy is
        collapsing. Education is often conducted online due to the constant
        threat of missile attacks. Temperatures of -27°C, the absence of heating
        and electricity in apartments — all of this creates enormous challenges
        for the learning process.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        At the same time, global issues such as smartphone addiction and the
        difficulties of adolescence have not disappeared in Ukraine.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Everything looks like an impending collapse — like a house of cards
        trembling in the wind, ready to fall apart at any moment.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        And yet, the most alarming part is that this fragile state is part of
        the defense of the entire civilized world.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        At a time of war, education should become a pillar of the state —
        playing a leading role in shaping national consciousness, fostering
        respect for Ukrainian history, and strengthening the Ukrainian language.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The current situation directly points to a dangerous future in which
        there may be no one left willing to defend Ukraine — and, consequently,
        Europe as a whole.
      </Paragraph>
      <Strong>
        {" "}
        Investing in Ukrainian education today means investing in the shared
        future of us all.

      <Paragraph></Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        However, I am convinced of one thing: education is not merely a sector
        of the economy. It is the foundation of the future.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        Being a teacher is not about salary. It is about influence. About
        values. About the kind of people who will grow up in 10 - 15 years.
        Teachers shape critical thinking, the ability to analyze, to empathize,
        to make conscious decisions. And if we lose respect for education, we
        lose more than just a system — we lose our direction of development.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        Yes, today is difficult. Yes, the system is under immense pressure. But
        now more than ever, education needs voices instead of silence. It needs
        professionals who refuse to give up. It needs a serious public
        conversation.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        {" "}
        I continue to write about pedagogy and teaching English because I
        believe knowledge is a tool of freedom. English is access to the world.
        Education is opportunity.{" "}
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        And as long as there are those who teach and those who are willing to
        learn, this house of cards will not fall. It may shake — but it will
        stand. Because it stands not on the system, but on people.
