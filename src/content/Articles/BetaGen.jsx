      <ArticleTitle>AI and Education of the Beta Generation</ArticleTitle>

      <Paragraph>
        The theory of generations is more of a social phenomenon than a purely
        chronological one. Generations are shaped by significant changes in
        society—during the period when a person is growing up. If this time
        coincides with large-scale events such as revolutions, wars, or global
        transformations, a new generation is formed with characteristic values
        and a distinct worldview.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The temporal boundaries of generations may be revised in the future.
        However, as of today, it is generally accepted that{" "}
        <Strong>Generation Beta</Strong> includes people born approximately
        between 2025 and 2040. Accordingly, in 2026 the first representatives of
        Generation Beta will turn one year old. Their era of flourishing, social
        contribution, and the formation of their own values, trends, and life
        beliefs will occur during their coming of age—roughly between 2042 and
        2070.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        It is likely that Generation Beta will perceive artificial intelligence
        very differently from how we do today. AI will become an essential tool:
        children will no longer know what life without AI is. Contemporary AI
        systems do not possess consciousness or independent thinking; they are
        tools for information processing and interfaces for interaction between
        humans and digital systems.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Secondary school education for Generation Beta will likely take place
        from the late 2030s to the mid-2050s—a period of rapid development and
        everyday integration of AI into education. By that time, AI will have
        advanced significantly, and{" "}
        <Strong>AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)</Strong> may
        emerge—general artificial intelligence capable of performing a wide
        range of intellectual tasks at or near the human level.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        This could trigger profound societal debates: some people may believe
        that AI possesses consciousness, emotions, and moral status, and new
        ideological or even religious movements could form around it.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        What education will look like depends on decisions made today—and solely
        on us. Will we conclude that working with AI should be controlled and
        limited for children in order to stimulate their cognitive activity? Or,
        conversely, will we adapt AI so that it directly participates in
        learning without turning into a tool for instantly obtaining ready-made
        answers?
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        There is a view that with the emergence of new technologies, human
        intelligence does not decline; rather, new abilities appear that did not
        previously exist. Undoubtedly, new skills and forms of thinking will
        emerge. However, at the same time, most contemporary studies—including
        research within the framework of{" "}
        <Strong>The Flynn Effect and Its Reversal</Strong>—directly indicate a
        decline in cognitive indicators among population groups that mindlessly
        spend a significant amount of time on the internet, immersed in a
        constant flow of fragmented information, short videos, and rapid
        stimuli.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        This is where one of the greatest dangers lies. We must not allow this
        way of life to become the norm for future generations.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        In my opinion, the integration of AI into the education of the future is
        inevitable. Society will have to adapt to new realities and reconsider
        educational principles and the very concept of learning. Skills that
        were relevant in the past are gradually losing their value in the
        future, and the pace of these changes is accelerating every year.
        Accordingly, curricula and subjects must also change.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Greater emphasis and responsibility should be shifted to primary
        education—the period when brain neuroplasticity is particularly high.
        This includes the formation of fundamental skills: reading, writing, and
        arithmetic; well-developed communication skills; the ability to retell
        and comprehend information; the study of foreign languages and
        programming.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Cognitive skills should occupy a special place—critical thinking,
        analysis, the ability to learn independently, and adaptability. At the
        same time, secondary school should become more specialized than it is
        today, while maintaining flexibility and the ability to change quickly
        in response to students' needs.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        AI is capable of communicating effectively with a student, adequately
        assessing progress, and motivating through praise where appropriate.
        Educational AI should be able to communicate in language understandable
        to a child, without immediately providing ready-made solutions, instead
        stimulating independent thinking and problem-solving.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        In this model, AI acts not as a source of answers, but as a tool for
        correction, support, and guidance. It is important that an educational
        AI agent use scientifically grounded learning principles, in particular
        the system of <Strong>spaced repetition</Strong> described by Hermann
        Ebbinghaus. If this principle is automated and combined with practical
        tasks, the learning process will become significantly more effective and
        faster.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        In addition, AI can become the primary tool for knowledge assessment,
        gradually replacing traditional tests. It is capable of simultaneously
        analyzing thousands of parameters of a student's learning activity and
        instantly providing an objective result with deep analytical feedback,
        significantly minimizing errors and the human factor.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Already today, initiatives are emerging to integrate AI into educational
        systems. In particular, the possibility of using the{" "}
        <Strong>Grok chatbot</Strong>, developed by xAI, in public schools in El
        Salvador is being publicly discussed—as part of potential educational
        programs of the future. In the future, similar initiatives are likely to
        appear more frequently and continue to improve.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The question is not whether AI will enter education. The question is
        whether we will manage to establish rules, values, and boundaries for
        its use before technology does it for us.
